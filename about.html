    <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Project Name</h2>
    <p>DodgeDodgeDodge!</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>Dodge the obstacles that come your way! It’s like dodgeball, except you aren’t throwing any balls. Actually, there are no balls in this game at all. Just really big blocks that are trying to knock you out!</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Arcade</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop web only for now (hopefully mobile friendly during development)</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>It’s abstract, the entire premise is that you’re a little square dude having stuff thrown at you that you need to dodge, for no reason other than "just because."</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Very simple graphics, likely made up of simple geometric shapes (squares, circles, rectangles, triangles, etc.)</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Disincentives (losing health with each hit for up to three hits)</li>
        <li>Endless Games (it just keeps going until you lose all of your health)</li>
        <li>Modifiers (ways to attack blocks for a small amount of time, point multipliers, shields, etc)</li>
        <li>(if possible) a scoreboard! For the current user’s computer/browser/platform (this is a stretch though)</li>
        <li><strike>I plan to provide a small tutorial level that the user could choose to play. It would move slower than the actual game would, and provide more allowance for mistakes in an effort to ensure that the user knows the controls.</strike> I plan for the controls in the browser to be the arrow keys or WASD keys. For mobile, it’d be a finger drag</li>
        <li>Instead of offering a smaller version of the game as a tutorial level, I may instead offer a small window where the player can practice the controls without playing the actual game. Or, I could just display the controls on the screen.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure about anything external I plan on using, I'll have to do a bit more research and see what I'll do</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>Concerning the powerups and enhancements, I may give the user a random powerup at different point levels (5pts, 10pt, 15pt, etc), then they can have the option of activating the power up with the spacebar. If this is the case, they'll only be able to hold one powerup at a time, and I'll make sure to include a boolean to check for that. The icon for the powerup will probably be next to the area the lives are displayed in.</p>
    <p>I could also add a powerup image to the screen that the user picks up. I will have an image icon at the top of the screen that will represent the powerup that is currently activated. If I go with the idea of using a random power up, I might just activate it for them without the spacebar activation (to make things easier for me). Then, it will stay active for a few seconds and deactivate.</p>
    <P>The tutorial is looking like a stretch, I think I will just include the instructions on the screen next to the game (along with other information if I can think of anything that needs to be included). If I manage to get the tutorial done, then I will do so. Otherwise, it wil be okay without it.</P>
