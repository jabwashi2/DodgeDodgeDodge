This is my (currently unfinished) web game title DodgeDodgeDodge!
DodgeDodgeDodge is a single player arcade game where the player dodges all of the obstacles as quickly as possible!

# Tools Used
This game was created using the PixiJS Graphics Engine and written primarily in JavaScript anc HTML.

# Future Plans
This game will be finished in the future! Currently, though the game is "playable," there are obvious visual issues that are being addressed. Updates soon!
